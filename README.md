# gsp-project
Course project 

**Abstract**: GPS-enabled devices have become an integral part of everyday
life, leading to a massive amount of mobility data being
generated. In addition to being high in volume, mobility
data is high-dimensional. This makes it challenging to
discern underlying mobility patterns in a raw spatiotemporal
form. Therefore, a representation that clearly accounts for
spatial and temporal mobility patterns is needed. This project
focuses on applying the graph representation technique for a
sparse representation and analysis of mobility data. We analyze
the mobility traffic traces from GPS traces of 182 users in
Beijing. First, we show that mobility data can be represented
using a directed graph. The resulting graph has a degree distribution
exhibiting the power-law distribution of human mobility
found in the literature. Second, we extract interesting
locations based on the graphâ€™s properties. Finally, we study
the potential application of GSP for analyzing the temporal
dynamics of mobility by considering an average movement
of users over some small time window in a given node as a
signal to the graph.
